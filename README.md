# carp_model

Models for asian carp spread.

(For conciseness, we refer to all bodies of water (even rivers) as lakes.)

Model 1 determines, given a maxiumum budget, which connections between lakes should be blocked off to maximize the total value of all of the lakes protected from carp.

Model 2 models the carp populations in different lakes over time, given their carrying capacities and information about the connections between the lakes.
